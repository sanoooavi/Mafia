# Advanced Programming Mini Project: Mafia

This repository contains a simple game developed as a mini project for the Advanced Programming course. The game is implemented using object-oriented programming (OOP) principles and follows clean code practices.

## Game Description

The game is a text-based interactive game where players take on different roles and try to win by strategizing and making decisions. The objective of the game is to eliminate the opposing team or achieve a specific goal depending on the game rules.

## Features

- Multiple player roles: The game includes various player roles such as Joker, Godfather, Doctor, Detective, Bulletproof, and more. Each role has unique abilities and characteristics.
- Day and night cycles: The game alternates between day and night phases. During the day, players discuss and vote to eliminate a player. During the night, players with special roles can perform actions.
- Role-specific actions: Each player role has specific actions they can perform during the night phase. These actions can influence the outcome of the game and player interactions.
- Clean code structure: The codebase follows clean code practices, with well-organized classes, meaningful variable names, and proper code documentation.
- Object-oriented design: The game is implemented using object-oriented programming principles, ensuring modularity, extensibility, and code reusability.

## Acknowledgements

- The game design and rules were inspired by various party games and board games.
- The project structure and code organization were influenced by clean code principles and OOP best practices.
